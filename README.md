# HeartTrack (HTK) â€“ Real-Time Cardiovascular Monitoring Device  

## Description  
**HeartTrack (HTK)** is an innovative device designed for real-time cardiovascular health monitoring. The project integrates the **AD8232 ECG sensor** to detect the heart's electrical activity and the **MAX30102 Pulse Oximeter** to measure blood oxygen levels (SpOâ‚‚). The device provides comprehensive analysis of heart rhythm and oxygenation, identifying anomalies such as arrhythmias, tachycardia, bradycardia, or early signs of myocardial infarction.  

## Key Features  
- **ECG Monitoring**: Detects cardiac abnormalities by analyzing the heart's electrical signals.  
- **Pulse Oximetry**: Measures blood oxygen saturation (SpOâ‚‚) and identifies associated risks.  
- **Automated Alerts**: Sends email notifications if abnormal values are detected.  
- **Portability**: Compact and user-friendly design, suitable for patients, athletes, or anyone monitoring their heart health.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Dual-screen display and simple button navigation.  

## Components & Technologies  
- **Hardware**:  
  - Raspberry Pi 4 and Raspberry Pi Pico for processing.  
  - AD8232 ECG sensor and MAX30102 Pulse Oximeter.  
  - Display screens, buttons, vibration sensor, and buzzer.  
- **Software**:  
  - Advanced algorithms for detecting P, Q, R, S, T points and ST segment.  
  - Neurokit2 library for ECG data processing.  
  - Threshold-based alert system.  

## Objectives  
- Preventing cardiovascular diseases through early diagnosis.  
- Providing an accessible and easy-to-use device for daily monitoring.  
- Improving quality of life through rapid intervention in case of anomalies.  

## Future Improvements  
- Developing a mobile app for real-time monitoring and notifications.  
- Enhancing the design for a more compact and comfortable experience.  
- Implementing automatic data transmission to healthcare providers.
